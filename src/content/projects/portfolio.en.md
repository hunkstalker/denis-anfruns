# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio developed with modern web technologies. Main features:

- **Modern Design**: Uses glassmorphism and subtle animations
- **Multilingual**: Full support for ES, CA and EN
- **SEO Optimized**: Metadata and semantic structure
- **Responsive**: Works perfectly on all devices
- **Dark Mode**: Theme system with local persistence

## Technologies Used

The project is built with:
- Astro as the main framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React for interactive components

## Challenges and Learnings

During development, I faced several interesting challenges such as implementing an SEO-friendly multilingual routing system and creating premium visual effects while maintaining performance.
