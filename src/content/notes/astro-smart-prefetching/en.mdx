When dealing with a multi-language website, the temptation is strong: "What if I background load (prefetch) all languages right upon entry so the switch is instant?"

### The Hidden Cost of "Eager Loading"

Massively loading pages that the user might never visit has consequences:

1.  **Data Waste**: If a user enters in Spanish and never switches, you have downloaded double or triple the weight uselessly.
2.  **Battery and CPU**: The browser has to parse and process those extra resources.
3.  **Saturation**: If your site has many images, aggressive prefetching competes for bandwidth with the content the user _is_ actually viewing right now.

### The Smart Strategy: Prefetch on Hover

Astro offers a perfect solution that anticipates **intent** rather than assuming behavior.

<CodeTabs
	items={[
		{
			label: 'Strategy',
			code: `<a href="/en" data-astro-prefetch="hover">
  English
</a>`,
			lang: 'html',
		},
	]}
/>

1.  The user moves the mouse towards the language button (clear intent).
2.  At that moment (`hover`), Astro downloads the destination page.
3.  It takes about ~200ms to click. By then, the page is already cached.

### Result

You get the same feeling of **instant navigation** (0ms) but only consume resources when there is a high probability that the user needs them. It's the perfect balance.
