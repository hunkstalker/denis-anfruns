Sometimes we mess up the last commit badly and a simple `revert` isn't enough. We want to wipe it off the face of the earth (locally and remotely) as if it never happened.

<Callout type="warning" title="Danger: Destructive" filled={true}>
	This method **deletes changes**. If you work in a team, make sure no one has pulled your changes
	before doing this, or you will have problems.
</Callout>

### 1. Fix message or forgotten file (Quick Option)

If you just made a typo in the message or forgot to add a file, you don't need to reset. Add the changes and "amend" the commit. This replaces the last commit with a new one fixing the mistake.

<CodeTabs
	items={[
		{
			label: 'Bash',
			code: `git add .
git commit --amend`,
			lang: 'bash',
		},
	]}
/>

When you run this, your default text editor (Vim, Nano, VS Code...) will open with the previous commit message.

1. Edit the message if you like.
2. **Save and close the file** (in Vim: `:wq`).
3. Git will detect you are done and create the new commit replacing the old one.

### 2. Go back without losing work (Local)

We use `reset --soft` to undo the commit but **keep your changes** staged. This way you can fix what was wrong, add what was missing, and commit again.

<CodeTabs
	items={[
		{
			label: 'Bash',
			code: `git reset --soft HEAD~1`,
			lang: 'bash',
		},
	]}
/>

### 3. Overwrite history (Remote)

Now your local repo is "in the past" but GitHub is still "in the future". If you try a normal push, git will reject you. You need to force write so the remote accepts your old version as the "absolute truth".

<CodeTabs
	items={[
		{
			label: 'Bash',
			code: `git push origin +main`,
			lang: 'bash',
		},
	]}
/>

> **Note**: The `+` symbol before the branch name (`+main`) is shorthand syntax for `--force`. It does the same thing but makes you feel more like a hacker.

## Dangerous Alternative: Hard Reset (The Nuclear Option)

If `git reset --soft` is like backspacing, `git reset --hard` is like burning the paper and starting fresh. It's the nuclear option for when you **don't want to recover anything** from your last commit.

<Callout type="warning" title="Extreme Danger" filled={true}>
	This command **permanently deletes** all changes in your uncommitted files. There is no (easy)
	going back. Use only if you are 100% sure your recent work is trash.
</Callout>

### 1. Erase all traces (Local)

This moves the pointer back and syncs your working directory to that old state.

<CodeTabs
	items={[
		{
			label: 'Bash',
			code: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`,
			lang: 'bash',
		},
	]}
/>

### 2. Force history (Remote)

Just like with soft reset, the remote will reject this because you rewrote the past.

<CodeTabs
	items={[
		{
			label: 'Bash',
			code: `git push origin +main`,
			lang: 'bash',
		},
	]}
/>
