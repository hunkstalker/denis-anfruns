# Power FX Delegation in SharePoint

"Delegation" is the ability of Power Apps to say to the server: "You filter these 10 million records and give me only the 5 I need".

SharePoint has severe limitations with this. Many functions are not delegable, meaning Power Apps has to download the first 500 (configurable up to a maximum of 2000 in app settings) records and filter them **locally**. If your data is in record 2001, **you will never see it**.

### Common non-delegable functions

- Complex date manipulation (e.g., `Month(DateColumn)`).
- Complex text searches (e.g., `Search` on numeric columns).

### Solution: Calculated Columns or Defaults

Instead of calculating at runtime, prepare the data.

<CodeTabs 
  items={[
    { 
      label: 'Power Apps',
      code: `// ❌ Non-delegable (asks for everything and filters locally)
Filter(Orders, Year(Created) = 2024)

// ✅ Delegable (passes a date range to the server)
Filter(Orders, Created >= Date(2024,1,1) && Created <= Date(2024,12,31))`,
