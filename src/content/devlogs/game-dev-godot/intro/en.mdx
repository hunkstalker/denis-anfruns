## Welcome to Game Dev Science 🧪

If you are here, it's because you want to make video games. But you don't just want to copy code from a YouTube tutorial and pray for it to work. You want to **understand** what's happening under the hood.

In this series, we're not going to create loose experiments. We're going to build **ONE complete game from start to finish**: **"Space Survivor"** 🚀.

### What will we learn?
This isn't your typical "Drag this node here" course. Here we're going to mix **Godot** with **Real Fundamentals**:

1.  **Math Without Fear**: Why does your ship move weirdly diagonally? The answer is in **Unit Vectors**. How do we make enemies surround us? **Trigonometry (Sin/Cos)**.
2.  **Shaders (The Juice)**: We'll make things glow, blink, and explode by manipulating pixels directly.

### Preparation

1.  Godot includes everything you need to start. You could write code from any editor, but Godot also includes a built-in code editor (IDE) that will help you write and debug your code.
2.  So please go to [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org) and download the latest stable version (Godot 4.x). Or you can simply download it from Steam, it is useful to keep the engine updated to the latest version.
3.  If you have downloaded it, once unzipped, run it! Godot does not need installation. And that's it! You can carry it on a USB. And if you downloaded it from Steam run it like any game.

### Your First Mission 📝

1.  Create a new project called `SpaceSurvivor`.
2.  Explore the interface. Don't be overwhelmed, just look at the four main screens: 2D, 3D, Script, and AssetLib at the top center.

In the next chapter, we'll leave the theory and write our first script to bring our ship to life. Prepare your vectors!
