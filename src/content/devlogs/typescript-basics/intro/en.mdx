## Welcome! 🚀

This is the first part of a series that will try to make us understand TypeScript _**for real**_, not just so we copy and paste "any" when the compiler complains.

The goal of the entire series is to end up understanding that TypeScript is not just JavaScript with typing, but that TypeScript is a typing proto-language to create any type structure we need for our projects and to ensure that, yes, everything is slower and heavier with the damn 👹 warnings, but in the end we gain code safety and robustness.

I am no expert, but I have always thought that the best way to learn is to try to teach others. This forces us to address each topic in a way that anyone can understand and see it from many perspectives.

That's why, in this series, I will try to explain every concept from scratch, without using complex technical terms, or at least explaining them in a way that is understandable to everyone.

I won't fool anyone; I use whatever I have at hand to learn, and in this case, it involves asking AI about the basic concepts of TypeScript. A good use of AI is that it can help us understand concepts, and it helps me create the chapters of the series and forces me to review them to explain them in an understandable way. At this moment, I have completed the 13 chapters of the series, and if I understood them, I'm sure you will too 🤣
