If you load multiple collections in the `App.OnStart` event one after another with `;;`, you are wasting time. The `Concurrent` function evaluates all formulas at the same time in parallel.

<CodeTabs 
  items={[
    { 
      label: 'Power Apps',
      code: `// ❌ Slow (sequential)
ClearCollect(Users, Office365Users.SearchUser());
ClearCollect(Departments, ["IT", "HR", "Sales"]);

// ✅ Fast (parallel)
Concurrent(
    ClearCollect(Users, Office365Users.SearchUser()),
    ClearCollect(Departments, ["IT", "HR", "Sales"])
);`, 
      lang: 'power fx' 
    }
  ]}
/>

Use it at app startup (`OnStart`) or on buttons that launch many independent processes.

<Callout type="warning" title="Mind the separator" filled>
  Remember that if your Power Apps is configured for the **European region**, you will need to change commas `,` to semicolons `;` in formulas. And use double semicolons `;;` for chaining functions where normally a single semicolon `;` would be used.

This reduces the app startup time drastically, especially when connecting to multiple data sources.
