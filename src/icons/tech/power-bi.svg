  <!-- Tall Bar (Right/Back) - represented by the 'x=256' in user snippet, actually usually the rightmost one is largest. -->
  <!-- Official logo: 3 bars. 
       1. Small (Left)
       2. Medium (Middle)
       3. Large (Right) -> Logic seems to indicate growing trend.
       Wait, the logo is actually varying heights. 
       Let's stick to the visual standard: Graph increasing.
