# Project Overview
The project is a personal web portfolio of a web developer (Denis Anfruns Millán) where he showcases his work experience, his learning process, and shares everything to help others learn with him. The website offers several sections.

- **Home**: Landing page of the website where the developer's name, profile as a developer, years of experience, and technology stack are displayed.
- **Devlog**: A development diary organised into chapters. When the developer embarks on a new project, he wants to record the entire process, from the step-by-step creation of the project to the final structure, so that anyone can follow his path.
- **TIL (Today I Learned)**: A section of notes that are brief tidbits of knowledge about things that are good to learn or remember.
- **TIL (Today I Learned) Series**: This is essentially the same section as the previous one, but instead of being a single note, it is a series of posts structured in a series. The idea is to create mini-series of knowledge with an exercise, a short course with a few chapters.
- **Projects**: Section where each project developed is presented along with a paper explaining the purpose of the project, the idea/objective of the project, what it offers/the solution it provides, UI/UX analysis, development process and technical information, as well as its FOSS repository. If possible, this section would be linked to Devlog, where the development process is located.

The website is available in Spanish, Catalan and English.
